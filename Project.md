# The title of your game #

## Summary ##

Our game, "Revenge of Zissors", is a top-down zombie shooter; the setting is a zombie apocalypse. Players will get a birds eye view of the map and use a gun to kill zombies. The game features 4 guns pistol, smg, assault rifle, and sniper rifle which have distinct fire rate, accuracy, damage, and bullet velocity stats associated with them. Guns are picked up off the ground. Players can also upgrade their gun by crafting, which consumes scrap, a material dropped by zombies. However, players cannnot move while crafting, so beware! Zombies also drop bandages, allowing the player to heal. Zombies spawn in waves, with each wave getting bigger then the last. Zombies also get ramping health. Be sure to upgrade your gun to keep up! At a certain poin in the game, a boss zombie, Zissors, spawn. Zissors has a unique attack patter, and is much more bulky then the base zombies. Defeating Zissors wins you the game!

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**
The player uses WASD to move. Players are substantially faster than zombies, so staying moving is essential to survival. On game start, the player should roam the map looking for a gun spawn, since they are significantly more powerful then the base pistol. The town block the player starts in has 80 potential locations for gun spawns, so keep your eyes peeled! Because zombie count and health scale with wave, upgrading your gun is essential. Crafting allows a boost to either a base stat, or apply a multiplier, which significantly improves your DPS. Crafting requires scrap, which is dropped by zombies, so be sure to kill zombies. Hold E to craft. It takes 2 seconds where the player can't move, so be careful! Zombies also drop bandages, which can be consumed by pressing Q. Something to note is that the camera enables players to see further in the direction they're facing and less in the direction they're not. Because this creates a blind spot, be sure to check your six!

# External Code, Ideas, and Structure #

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

For each team member, you shoudl work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.
